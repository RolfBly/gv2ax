## gv2ax - Getty Vocabularies to Adlib XML

Gv2ax lets you use Getty Vocabularies AAT as a built-in authority file in Adlib collection management software. 

Gb2ax is a webservice built in Python 3.7 and Flask. This repository makes it an open source project and allows for easier deployment. 

For more information, see templates/index_content_en.html (English) or templates/index_content_nl.html (Dutch)

Gv2ax can run as a local service using Flask's built in test server. Not recommended for production. You will need a virtual Python 3.7 environment with Flask, requests and lxml. See requirements.txt.
